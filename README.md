# Kirby Fight!

Kirby Fight! is a group project made by Srayuth Choun, Timothy Nguyen, and Deanna Sulli for the LearningFuze hacka-tictactoe-athon. It was chosen as the winner for its unique mechanics and creativity. It is a Kirby version of Tic-Tac-Toe where two players can choose a kirby with special abilities that affect the game. 

Currently, this game is meant to be played on the same device; however a future version may use AI for the second player and/or online multiplayer.
